## Answer One
This one is tricky. I keep thinking of the movie *Labyrinth*, where the main character was faced with a similar problem. At the time I was sure her logic was sound, but **she got it _wrong_ and fell down a _pit_.**

Anyway, you ask:
"If I asked what path would lead to paradise, what path would the other guard point to?"

If you ask the guard who tells the truth, they would show you the path the liar would point to. Not *paradise* but __death__.

If you ask the guard who tells lies, they would *not* show you the path the truth guard would point to. That path would be __death__, not *paradise*.

So *don't* got down the path the guard you asked the question to shows you.
	
## Answer Two
It's a painting of the man's son.
He has no siblings, so "my father's son" is himself.
He says that "That man's father" is the same as "My father's son".
Therefore he is "That man's father", and so "That man" is his son.

```
   Son   >                 Father            > Grandfather
That man > That man's father/My father's son > My Father
```
